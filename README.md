# Linux-Program-Installation-Scripts

A repo for scripts to simplify the process of installing things on Linux.

I'm sure the technomancers have more advanced ways of doing this, but if you're like me and find yourself googling "how to install X on linux" a lot, than this repo is for you. All the files are just the list of cammand you'll find on the guide and installation websites, but placed into a an script file you can double click.
